A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/kunukn/pen/oLQGAG.

 Playing with Gooey and CSS animation and with configuration option. Tested with Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, IE11. I wanted to test Gooey effect and dynamic CSS animation changes in different browsers. The IE required a hack and Gooey only showed to work in Chrome and Firefox when I tested it.
